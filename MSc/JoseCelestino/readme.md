## 2D RGB Head Pose Estimation in Face Occlusion Scenarios

**Keywords:** Head Pose Estimation, Euler Angles, Occlusion, Neural Networks

### Summary:

Head pose estimation, the task that deals with the prediction of the orientation of human heads from images or videos, is a challenging Computer Vision problem that has been extensively researched and
has a wide variety of applications. Despite several studies having been carried out to achieve the most accurate pose prediction possible, current state of the art systems still exhibit a much larger estimation
error in the presence of occlusions. This inaccurate prediction makes them inadequate and unreliable for many task applications in such occlusion scenarios.
This thesis proposes to study different methodologies in order to achieve a robust head pose estimation in occlusion scenarios, for images, videos and real-world applications. The implemented methodologies are based on the development of personalized occluded training and testing sets and the adaptation
of state of the art deep learning network frameworks and strategies.
We show that our models improve occluded head pose estimation and achieve state of the art non-occluded estimation results. We demonstrate the application of our best method in the real-life context of
Feedbot, an autonomous feeding robotic arm. We reveal that our model performs better than a state of
the art model for the occlusions of the robotic arm, while achieving similar performance for non-occluded
estimation.
