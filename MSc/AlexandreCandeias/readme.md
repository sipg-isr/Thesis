## Feedbot: A Vision Augmented Feeding Robot

**Keywords:** Assistive Technologies, Manipulation Aids, Feeding Assistance, Computer Vision, Head Pose Tracking

### Summary:

People with disabilities are unable to execute several simple daily tasks, such as feeding or dressing, and often rely on other people to help them. Researchers have over time developed robotic feedingassistants to help at meals so that people with disabilities can live more autonomously. However, current commercial feeding assistant robots acquire food without feedback on acquisition success and deliver it in a pre-programmed location. We propose Feedbot, an autonomous feeding robot arm that is augmented with vision to be capable of adapting his trajectories in real-time to the user and of having visual feedback on the food acquisition. Feedbot was tested in a real meal scenario and using two different robot arms. We show how Discriminative Optimization (DO) can be applied to track the user’s head pose so that the food can be effectively brought all the way to the user’s mouth, rather than to a pre-programmed feeding location. Our results show the ability of DO to track the head pose, while achieving state of the art performance. Finally, we show that visual feedback can improve the effectiveness of food acquisition.
