## Feedbot: Clustering of movement profiles of motor-impaired peoplefrom 2D image streams

**Keywords:** Movement Classification, Structure from Motion, Bag of Words, Matrix completion, Trajectory Feature

### Summary:

Ageing, motor disorders and accidents are some possible causes that lead people to require help from caregivers, being impossible for patients to have autonomy. Assistive robots have been developed to help them in tasks such as feeding. However, as each patient is a different case, so it is imperative to classify them and adapt the technology to better serve their needs.
The aim of this work was a methodology which focused on classifying different subjects based on the manifestation of their disabilities in a specific setup. This would enable a better adaptation of robotic systems to adapt to each patient and consequently improve their performance.  To achieve this result, a data set was created with recordings of people with and without physical limitations, while performing given tasks.
Data from specific points was acquired from these videos using a facial landmark detector. Nevertheless, this data was incomplete, and so a matrix completion procedure with a Structure from Motion framework was used. Afterwards, the trajectories of the subjects were encoded onto two different fetures. These features were then used to build a classifier, based on the Bag of Words model, aiming to discern the different types of subjects depending on their performance.
During the clustering phase, it was possible to identify specific patterns associated to specific type of subjects. The results obtained were quite promising as they proved that the feasibility this study.
