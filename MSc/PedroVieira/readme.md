**Keywords:** Cyclist, HRV, Optical-flow, Smartphone, Stress, Traffic

### Summary:

Given ecological and socioeconomic aspects, the bicycle is slowly becoming the main way of transportation to a lot of people. In fact, the number of cyclists in the city streets has been increasing in the past few years. In this master thesis a smartphone app and a method was developed to study the urban cyclists. It shows how today smartphones can be used to study this increasing activity. Due to the fact that these devices are equipped with several sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, GPS receivers and good cameras, they become the perfect candidates for this task.
